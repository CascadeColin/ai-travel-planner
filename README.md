### Technical Solution

#### Scenario 1:
Gemma has never traveled to Europe and does not know exactly where to go on the continent.  She also has a busy life and limited time to plan this trip, despite really needing to go on it to get a break from that busy life.  By inputting a list of destination cities, setting a budget, and specifying travel dates, AI Travel Planner does the hard work for her and presents options for all of her destination cities.

#### Scenario 2:
Jeff is a busy executive assistant for the CEO of a Fortune 500 company that needs to quickly plan a large business trip for the company.  He already has a high workload maintaining his boss's daily schedule.  He was able to abstract away planning this business trip by inputting trip details into AI Travel Planner and selecting the "save money" option to help save money on company expenses.

### User Stories - See 'TASKS.md' for detailed implementation

Precondition:  Planner must have a valid user account.

Post-condition:  Planner will not have to interact with Config and Preset again, unless they choose to change their preferences.

#### Create a Trip

Create a Trip based on Planner's Config and Preset.  The travel options presented to the user can be one or more trips.  The final Trip is chosen by the user and saved in their profile.

Precondition:  Trip must start in the future.  Trip must be on Earth (but I'd love to plan space travel some day!).

Post-condition:  Planner may set the Trip as "fully planned" once they book the flights, lodging, and any other specified details".

#### Edit a Trip

Edit a Trip if plans change.  Any detail of a future Trip can be changed.

Precondition:  Trips end date must be in the future (okay to modify an active trip).

#### Cancel a Trip

Cancels a Trip if plans change.
